# Hi there, I'm QuÃ¢n
### Welcome to my portfolio!
### I'm a 17-year old Vietnamese who likes tinkering with tech things.

## Some infos about me
- I play [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) and osu!
- I used to own ThiccMC, a Minecraft network. It was fun while it lasted.
- I'm currently a first-year @ CMC University
- My music taste is kinda 'diverse' as I listen to a lot of genres of songs. I can list some artists such as Ehrling, Glass Animals, R3HAB, Ngot and Kien Trinh.
- Romcom is my favorite category of animes and mangas. I really love the series "The Quintessential Quintuplets" and I adapted Miku Nakano as my waifu ðŸ˜­
- I'm an Apple fanboy. I also do hackintoshes and use Linux (5 years of Linux sysadmin experience!)
- I self-host my servers (the process is easier than you think ðŸ˜†)
- The Linux distribution that I use is Debian (both on my daily driver and my servers!)
- I also have a strange obsession with home automation
